# h2-6-weather
A weather app to search for current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast for a city of your choosing.
<br><br>

### __City Forcast__
I used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities that can be accessed from the search box at the top of the page. Once you enter the city and use the "Click Me" button you will be given the current weather and the next 5 days. 
<br><br>

### __Goals and Impressions__

The goal is to create a working weather function with the following features:

* Create an attractive User Interface
* Allow users to enter a city and view current weather
* Show the following 5 day forecast
* Pull content from local storage and back into interface for saved weather history

<br>
I was able to achieve a majoity of the functionality but due to challenges during development I had to restart my code and did not get the local storage feature live. I would like to come back and add additional functionality at a later time.
